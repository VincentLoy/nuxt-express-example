## Express with Nuxt as a middleware

This is a test project that use [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) as a middleware of [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
The app is actually using **Nuxt v0.7.6** and have to bind the render middleware.
This [**v0.7.7** of nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v0.7.7) fix that problem.
